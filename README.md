	- An open-sourced platform named BioPhi by Merck and researchers from academia. BioPhi is consist of two models: **Sapiens** is a deep learning humanization method trained on the OAS using language modeling; **OASis** is a granular, interpretable and diverse humanness score based on 9-mer peptide search in the OAS. BioPhi thus offers an antibody design interface with automated methods that capture the richness of natural antibody repertoires to produce therapeutics with desired properties and accelerate antibody discovery campaigns. The BioPhi platform is accessible at https://biophi.dichlab.org and https://github.com/Merck/BioPhi.
