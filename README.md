	- This work (by AI+antibody biotech company [Absci](https://www.absci.com/)) demonstrates that the approach of combining high-throughput affinity measurements and generative AI can accelerate drug(antibody) discovery. The data was made [open-sourced](https://github.com/AbsciBio/unlocking-de-novo-antibody-design).

## Pretrained language model

- **AntiBERTy(2021)**
  - Ruffolo, Jeffrey A., Jeffrey J. Gray, and Jeremias Sulam. 2021. ‚Äú**Deciphering Antibody Affinity Maturation with Language Models and Weakly Supervised Learning.**‚Äù arXiv. [https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2112.07782](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2112.07782).
	- This work introduces¬†**AntiBERTy**, a language model trained on **558M** natural antibody sequences that finds that within repertoires, the model clusters antibodies into trajectories resembling affinity maturation, and shows that models trained to predict highly redundant sequences under a multiple instance learning framework identify key binding residues in the process.


- **Antibody Benchmark(2022)**
  - Anonymous. 2022. ‚Äú**On Pre-Training Language Model for Antibody.**‚Äù In . [https://openreview.net/forum?id=zaq4LV55xHl](https://openreview.net/forum?id=zaq4LV55xHl).
  - This work (currently under peer review) developes the first comprehensive antibody benchmark, including tasks with varying antibody specificity: antigen-binding discrimination, antibody paratope prediction, B cell maturation analysis and antibody dicovery. The authors observed that including biological mechanism of antibody maturation in the training process improve the language model's performance on highly antibody-specific question.
